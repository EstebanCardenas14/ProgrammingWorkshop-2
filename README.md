SYSTEMS ENGINEERING SEMESTER 3

Programming workshop 2 Members:
- Cardenas Cortes Luis Esteban
- Galvis Bolivar Andres Felipe
- Anaya Ramirez Paula Andrea
- Sanchez Malagon Cristian David

The purpose requested in the programming project 2 was to create an application that allows you to manage the database of "Citizens of 4 Legs", using the same problem as workshop 1, this application must have the following characteristics:

- Load dataset, it must be available as a static resource and the data structure must be handled JSON type
- Create a table where the dataset records can be viewed.
- Create a form where the registration of an animal can be completed by adding fields such as
   - race
   - owner
   - address
   - picture.
- Create an option to add a new animal to the list, which must display a form
- BONUSES:
   - Add two optional fields that allow you to type the coordinates of the animal and thus show the geolocation on a map
   - You can also do the reverse process that allows the user to select a point on the map and extract the coordinates associated with that point.
   - Show a map of Bogotá with all the animals that have geolocation
